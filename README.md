# Travel-OOP-thing

We decided to base our project on a Hotel rating system. It lets users record their trips with details like location,
date, rating. Trips could be sorted by date or rating and searched by country.

String - Country
String - Hotel name
Int - beds
Double - hotel price per day
Boolean - booked or not
LocalDate - Start Booking date
LocalDate - End Booking date
LocalDateTime - Check In time

Start with a menu of countries.
The user selects a country.
Display a list of sorting options for hotels (e.g., sort by rating, price, or favourites).
The user chooses a hotel from the sorted list.
Show a menu with each hotel’s details: Number of beds, Price per day, Whether it’s already booked or not
The user selects a hotel.
The user enters a start date and end date.
The program calculates the total cost based on the number of days and the daily rate.
Display whether the hotel is booked and the total cost.
Ask the user to confirm the booking (“Are you sure you want to book?”).
Once confirmed, display a summary of all booking details.
