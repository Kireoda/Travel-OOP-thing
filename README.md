The Hotel Management System is designed to help users record, manage, and track hotel room reservations efficiently. It allows users to store details about each room, including the hotel name, room number and type, capacity, price per night, booking status, maintenance dates, and hotel rating. Users can book rooms for specific dates, check availability, and cancel bookings. The system can calculate the total cost for a stay, update nightly rates, and manage hotel ratings. It also tracks and schedules maintenance to ensure rooms remain in good condition. Additionally, users can search for rooms by location or hotel and sort them by availability or rating. This program is useful both for travelers who want to plan and record their trips and for hotel staff who need to manage room availability, pricing, and maintenance efficiently.

Stage 1 – What to Deliver (40%)
Entity Definition (6%): Create a class with at least 7 fields, all encapsulated, with validation and clear messages.
CSV Loading (5%): Load exactly 10 rows, print the number of valid entries and show a sample.
