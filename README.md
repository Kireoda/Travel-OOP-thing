# Travel-OOP-thing

We decided to base our project on a Hotel management system. It lets users record their trips with details like location,
date, rating. Trips could be sorted by date or rating and searched by country.
String - HotelName
String - roomNumber
String - roomType
Int - capacity
Double - pricePerNight
Boolean - isBooked
LocalDate - lastMaintenanceDate
LocalDate - nextAvailableTime
int - hotelRating

Start with a menu to select a hotel to view/manage
Be able to look at details about the room
Calculate price of a stay
Sort rooms by price,capacity and type

Stage 1 - What to Deliver (40%)
Entity Definition	≥7 typed fields; encapsulated; validation with clear messages.	6%
CSV Loading	Load exactly 10 rows; print valid-count and a sample listing.	5%
Data Structure Choice	Use ArrayList or LinkedList with justification; show iteration and safe removal.	3%
Ordering & Searching	Implement Comparable (natural order) and one Comparator; show search/sort.	4%
DRY & Defensive Coding	Early exits, helper methods for repeated logic; no duplication hotspots.	3%
Reporting & Output	Brief, readable console output or formatted listing.	3%

Marking: Process & Quality (16%)
Repository Quality	Regular, meaningful commits; branches/tags; balanced contributions.	4%
Unit Testing & Coverage (baseline)	Driver/JUnit for ordering/search; ≥35% coverage; include evidence.	4%
Reporting & Documentation	Concise README/report: design rationale, defensive examples, contribution matrix, reflection.	8%
Reporting guidance (prose, not including code/figures)
